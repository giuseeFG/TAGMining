26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	X-Pingback: http://17andbaking.com/xmlrpc.php Link: ; rel=shortlink Content-Encoding: gzip Buttercream in Bloom | 17 and Baking Buttercream in Bloom Ever since I’ve begun blogging, I’ve noticed that 17 and Baking does have an effect on what I make
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I still daydream about unusual flavor combinations and sketch out cupcakes in class, but I’m also influenced by what I’ve already done
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I realized that I also try not to repeat myself, despite the clear trends in my preferences
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I can’t resist pumpkin, basil, and blood oranges, but their appearances on my blog have been limited since I always try to keep things different
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I find myself aiming for new recipes instead – I can’t blog about something I’ve already made
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But I’ve found that some of my favorite desserts, the creations I’ll ultimately keep closest to my heart, have been the ones created not for my blog, but for my own life
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	From to , the treats I bake for my family inevitably turn out well and become favorites
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love designing and baking birthday treats especially for my friends based on what they like
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I think about whether they’re a chocolate or vanilla person, and whether they’d like buttercream or ganache
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Beyond taste, the best part is deciding how to decorate whatever I make
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I try to really think about what my friends are like, what makes them the happiest, and what would really make their day a little sunnier
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	So when I set out to make these these Chrysanthemum Cupcakes for my artist friend M-, I already knew what I wanted to do
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Then I used my favorite to pipe each petal on top
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	One of the most frustrating things is when the vision in your head doesn’t match the dessert you produce
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But these cupcakes came together without trouble
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Nobody was more surprised than me when the flowers emerged from the piping tip petal by petal, delicate and smooth
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The bouquet of cupcakes on the table put a smile on everyone’s face when they walked by… I hope they brightened M-‘s birthday too
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Update – recently I wrote for the Seattle Times
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The recipe at the end features the piping technique from this post
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	A few days after publication, I got an email from Lisa of West Seattle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	She and her daughter made the cupcakes, shared them with friends and family, and emailed me this lovely poem about them
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I got her permission to share it here
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	THIS IS NOT A CUPCAKE This is spring on a bone china saucer rimmed in gold
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Lemon zest–that’s the sharp snap of a twig as you brush past fairy chandeliers of indian plum blooming along the creek
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	There’s pistachios–earthy and green, like lilac buds or the tip of a tulip; bulb-bursting and shooting for the clouds
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Because this is not a plate of cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s my affection, her crush, our love spread with buttercream and set with camellia petals– crinkled, pink, perfect
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take a taste of spring of the promise of sunshine of my heart– there’s more where that came from
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	- Lisa K., West Seattle These cupcakes are the quintessential American chocolate cake: light, moist, and full of chocolate flavor
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	They’re a snap to make and worked great with the buttercream
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	As for the meyer lemon curd, I picked a recipe that didn’t require a ton of yolks, and I couldn’t have been happier with the results
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s thick and tart – maybe a little too tart on its own – but paired with the chocolate cupcake and flower of frosting, it was a perfect complement to the sugar
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Line 36 cupcake tins with paper liners
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Mix on low speed to combine the ingredients
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	In another bowl, gently whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla extract
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer still on low speed, add the coffee and stir just to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is well combined
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Fill cupcake tins 3/4 full (I like to use a little cookie/ice cream scoop) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Cool on a wire rack
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Whisk together zest, juice, sugar, and eggs, then add the butter pieces
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Set over a saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk until smooth and thick, 160 degrees F on a thermometer
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Strain curd through a fine sieve into another bowl, cover with wax paper, and cool completely
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	To assemble Chrysanthemum Cupcakes (technique adapted from ) : Fill a piping bag fitted with a plain, round tip with the cooled meyer lemon curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Poke the piping tip directly into the cooled cupcakes and fill with curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Smooth a small amount into a thin circle on the top of the cupcakes – don’t worry about the center, just focus on the edges of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take the remaining buttercream and dye any colors you want for the petals (I chose light pink and yellow.) Fill in a piping bag fitted with a coupler to easily change tips
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	12 round tip and pipe a 1/2″ round dot on the center of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	80 tip (I used a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	81, and this is the tip that looks like a “U”)
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Hold the tip at a 45 degree angle next to the dot
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Squeeze and pull out in a quick stroke
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Continue around the dot, then make a second, third, and fourth layer of petals on top of the first, making the petals shorter each time
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Finally switch to a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	3 tip (a tiny open circle) and pipe three little dots on top

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I have been trying to do this myself without sucess but after reading your post I suspect I have been using the wrong nozzle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Will give them another go
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I’m sure your friend was delighted with them 8
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 25, 2010 at 11:35 am So
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love your blog so much, partly because I’m from Seattle, and partly because you’re a terrific writer, photographer and baker, and partly because you just sound like the kind of person I’d love to chat with

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Noelle  |  January 26, 2010 at 3:38 pm Wowwww
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Did you find these hard to transport?
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 6:45 pm Noelle – I have a cheap cake carrier that I use to transport all my baked goods
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I once made the mistake of trying to transport a 3 layer frosted cake all on my own
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Long story short, it was smushed against the sides of the cake carrier as I exited the freeway
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	These days, I ask someone else to drive, and I hold the cake carrier in my lap
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	My dad is a pretty smooth driver, so I didn’t have much trouble with these cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 6:05 pm Simply lovely

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I still daydream about unusual flavor combinations and sketch out cupcakes in class, but I’m also influenced by what I’ve already done
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I realized that I also try not to repeat myself, despite the clear trends in my preferences
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I can’t resist pumpkin, basil, and blood oranges, but their appearances on my blog have been limited since I always try to keep things different
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I find myself aiming for new recipes instead – I can’t blog about something I’ve already made
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But I’ve found that some of my favorite desserts, the creations I’ll ultimately keep closest to my heart, have been the ones created not for my blog, but for my own life
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	From to , the treats I bake for my family inevitably turn out well and become favorites
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love designing and baking birthday treats especially for my friends based on what they like
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I think about whether they’re a chocolate or vanilla person, and whether they’d like buttercream or ganache
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Beyond taste, the best part is deciding how to decorate whatever I make
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I try to really think about what my friends are like, what makes them the happiest, and what would really make their day a little sunnier
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	So when I set out to make these these Chrysanthemum Cupcakes for my artist friend M-, I already knew what I wanted to do
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Then I used my favorite to pipe each petal on top
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	One of the most frustrating things is when the vision in your head doesn’t match the dessert you produce
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But these cupcakes came together without trouble
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Nobody was more surprised than me when the flowers emerged from the piping tip petal by petal, delicate and smooth
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The bouquet of cupcakes on the table put a smile on everyone’s face when they walked by… I hope they brightened M-‘s birthday too
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Update – recently I wrote for the Seattle Times
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The recipe at the end features the piping technique from this post
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	A few days after publication, I got an email from Lisa of West Seattle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	She and her daughter made the cupcakes, shared them with friends and family, and emailed me this lovely poem about them
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I got her permission to share it here
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	THIS IS NOT A CUPCAKE This is spring on a bone china saucer rimmed in gold
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Lemon zest–that’s the sharp snap of a twig as you brush past fairy chandeliers of indian plum blooming along the creek
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	There’s pistachios–earthy and green, like lilac buds or the tip of a tulip; bulb-bursting and shooting for the clouds
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Because this is not a plate of cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s my affection, her crush, our love spread with buttercream and set with camellia petals– crinkled, pink, perfect
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take a taste of spring of the promise of sunshine of my heart– there’s more where that came from
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	- Lisa K., West Seattle These cupcakes are the quintessential American chocolate cake: light, moist, and full of chocolate flavor
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	They’re a snap to make and worked great with the buttercream
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	As for the meyer lemon curd, I picked a recipe that didn’t require a ton of yolks, and I couldn’t have been happier with the results
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s thick and tart – maybe a little too tart on its own – but paired with the chocolate cupcake and flower of frosting, it was a perfect complement to the sugar
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Line 36 cupcake tins with paper liners
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Mix on low speed to combine the ingredients
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	In another bowl, gently whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla extract
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer still on low speed, add the coffee and stir just to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is well combined
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Fill cupcake tins 3/4 full (I like to use a little cookie/ice cream scoop) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Cool on a wire rack
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Whisk together zest, juice, sugar, and eggs, then add the butter pieces
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Set over a saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk until smooth and thick, 160 degrees F on a thermometer
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Strain curd through a fine sieve into another bowl, cover with wax paper, and cool completely
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	To assemble Chrysanthemum Cupcakes (technique adapted from ) : Fill a piping bag fitted with a plain, round tip with the cooled meyer lemon curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Poke the piping tip directly into the cooled cupcakes and fill with curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Smooth a small amount into a thin circle on the top of the cupcakes – don’t worry about the center, just focus on the edges of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take the remaining buttercream and dye any colors you want for the petals (I chose light pink and yellow.) Fill in a piping bag fitted with a coupler to easily change tips
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	12 round tip and pipe a 1/2″ round dot on the center of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	80 tip (I used a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	81, and this is the tip that looks like a “U”)
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Hold the tip at a 45 degree angle next to the dot
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Squeeze and pull out in a quick stroke
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Continue around the dot, then make a second, third, and fourth layer of petals on top of the first, making the petals shorter each time
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Finally switch to a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	3 tip (a tiny open circle) and pipe three little dots on top

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I have been trying to do this myself without sucess but after reading your post I suspect I have been using the wrong nozzle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Will give them another go
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I’m sure your friend was delighted with them 8

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love your blog so much, partly because I’m from Seattle, and partly because you’re a terrific writer, photographer and baker, and partly because you just sound like the kind of person I’d love to chat with

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Noelle  |  January 26, 2010 at 3:38 pm Wowwww
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Did you find these hard to transport?
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 6:45 pm Noelle – I have a cheap cake carrier that I use to transport all my baked goods
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I once made the mistake of trying to transport a 3 layer frosted cake all on my own
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Long story short, it was smushed against the sides of the cake carrier as I exited the freeway
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	These days, I ask someone else to drive, and I hold the cake carrier in my lap
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	My dad is a pretty smooth driver, so I didn’t have much trouble with these cupcakes

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	My last blog (wordpress) was hacked and I ended up losing a few months of hard work due to no backup
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Do you have any methods to prevent hackers
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  March 30, 2014 at 10:33 pm At this time it sounds like Movable Type is the preferred blogging platform available right now
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	(from what I’ve read) Is that what you’re using on your blog
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  May 13, 2014 at 11:20 pm Amazing!!

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I still daydream about unusual flavor combinations and sketch out cupcakes in class, but I’m also influenced by what I’ve already done
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I realized that I also try not to repeat myself, despite the clear trends in my preferences
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I can’t resist pumpkin, basil, and blood oranges, but their appearances on my blog have been limited since I always try to keep things different
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I find myself aiming for new recipes instead – I can’t blog about something I’ve already made
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But I’ve found that some of my favorite desserts, the creations I’ll ultimately keep closest to my heart, have been the ones created not for my blog, but for my own life
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	From to , the treats I bake for my family inevitably turn out well and become favorites
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love designing and baking birthday treats especially for my friends based on what they like
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I think about whether they’re a chocolate or vanilla person, and whether they’d like buttercream or ganache
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Beyond taste, the best part is deciding how to decorate whatever I make
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I try to really think about what my friends are like, what makes them the happiest, and what would really make their day a little sunnier
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	So when I set out to make these these Chrysanthemum Cupcakes for my artist friend M-, I already knew what I wanted to do
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Then I used my favorite to pipe each petal on top
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	One of the most frustrating things is when the vision in your head doesn’t match the dessert you produce
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	But these cupcakes came together without trouble
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Nobody was more surprised than me when the flowers emerged from the piping tip petal by petal, delicate and smooth
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The bouquet of cupcakes on the table put a smile on everyone’s face when they walked by… I hope they brightened M-‘s birthday too
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Update – recently I wrote for the Seattle Times
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	The recipe at the end features the piping technique from this post
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	A few days after publication, I got an email from Lisa of West Seattle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	She and her daughter made the cupcakes, shared them with friends and family, and emailed me this lovely poem about them
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I got her permission to share it here
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	THIS IS NOT A CUPCAKE This is spring on a bone china saucer rimmed in gold
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Lemon zest–that’s the sharp snap of a twig as you brush past fairy chandeliers of indian plum blooming along the creek
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	There’s pistachios–earthy and green, like lilac buds or the tip of a tulip; bulb-bursting and shooting for the clouds
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Because this is not a plate of cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s my affection, her crush, our love spread with buttercream and set with camellia petals– crinkled, pink, perfect
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take a taste of spring of the promise of sunshine of my heart– there’s more where that came from
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	- Lisa K., West Seattle These cupcakes are the quintessential American chocolate cake: light, moist, and full of chocolate flavor
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	They’re a snap to make and worked great with the buttercream
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	As for the meyer lemon curd, I picked a recipe that didn’t require a ton of yolks, and I couldn’t have been happier with the results
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	It’s thick and tart – maybe a little too tart on its own – but paired with the chocolate cupcake and flower of frosting, it was a perfect complement to the sugar
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Line 36 cupcake tins with paper liners
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Mix on low speed to combine the ingredients
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	In another bowl, gently whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla extract
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	With the mixer still on low speed, add the coffee and stir just to combine
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is well combined
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Fill cupcake tins 3/4 full (I like to use a little cookie/ice cream scoop) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Cool on a wire rack
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Whisk together zest, juice, sugar, and eggs, then add the butter pieces
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Set over a saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk until smooth and thick, 160 degrees F on a thermometer
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Strain curd through a fine sieve into another bowl, cover with wax paper, and cool completely
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	To assemble Chrysanthemum Cupcakes (technique adapted from ) : Fill a piping bag fitted with a plain, round tip with the cooled meyer lemon curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Poke the piping tip directly into the cooled cupcakes and fill with curd
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Smooth a small amount into a thin circle on the top of the cupcakes – don’t worry about the center, just focus on the edges of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Take the remaining buttercream and dye any colors you want for the petals (I chose light pink and yellow.) Fill in a piping bag fitted with a coupler to easily change tips
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	12 round tip and pipe a 1/2″ round dot on the center of the cupcake
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	80 tip (I used a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	81, and this is the tip that looks like a “U”)
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Hold the tip at a 45 degree angle next to the dot
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Squeeze and pull out in a quick stroke
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Continue around the dot, then make a second, third, and fourth layer of petals on top of the first, making the petals shorter each time
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Finally switch to a No
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	3 tip (a tiny open circle) and pipe three little dots on top

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	My church is doing a chocolate auction for a fundraiser, and I wanted to make cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Unfortunately, I don’t think I have your patience to make those beautiful flowers- I am NOT known for my piping skills
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 24, 2010 at 11:27 am Hi, I didn’t know how to contact you so I left a comment here

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 24, 2010 at 6:58 pm Those chrysanthemums are GORGEOUS
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I’ll have to try that for sure on some cupcakes once spring comes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 24, 2010 at 10:30 pm Just gorgeous

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 25, 2010 at 4:10 am The flower cupcakes are stunning!
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I have been trying to do this myself without sucess but after reading your post I suspect I have been using the wrong nozzle
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Will give them another go
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I’m sure your friend was delighted with them 8
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 25, 2010 at 11:35 am So
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I love your blog so much, partly because I’m from Seattle, and partly because you’re a terrific writer, photographer and baker, and partly because you just sound like the kind of person I’d love to chat with
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Pearl  |  January 25, 2010 at 3:00 pm Those are so pretty!

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 12:07 pm Cute cupcakes (and blog!) 12
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Noelle  |  January 26, 2010 at 3:38 pm Wowwww
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Did you find these hard to transport?
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 6:45 pm Noelle – I have a cheap cake carrier that I use to transport all my baked goods
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I once made the mistake of trying to transport a 3 layer frosted cake all on my own
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Long story short, it was smushed against the sides of the cake carrier as I exited the freeway
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	These days, I ask someone else to drive, and I hold the cake carrier in my lap
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	My dad is a pretty smooth driver, so I didn’t have much trouble with these cupcakes
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 26, 2010 at 6:05 pm Simply lovely

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Definitely too pretty to eat
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Those must have been so much work
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	I’m glad it all paid off
26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	 |  January 27, 2010 at 8:50 pm These are absolutely darling

26a2c89f-ba52-442d-8f78-6be30cfb82e1	Anyway, I have just developed a passion for baking, however my mum hates it when I’m in the kitchen because I mess up the whole area
